# CmdLnParse

Goal of the project is command line argument parser for Pascal programs.

While there are the `GetOpt()`and `GetLongOpts()` functions, somehow I could not
get them running right. After to much time spent trying, I came to the point of
"How hard can it be ..." and this is the result.

## Build

Should be easy to compile from any Pascal environment.
Developed using FPC and Visual Studio Code with the OmniPascal extension.

Debugger under MS-Windows is msys64\\mingw64\\bin\\gdb.exe

## Test

There is a `cmdLnParser_demo.pas` in the repository. Try to build this one and 
run it.

Tested on:
- Windows 7
- Ubuntu 18.04

## Documentation

The source code is the documentation. It is short and has a lot of comments.
If there are still questions, feel free to ask (nicely!).
